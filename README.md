## Project
### A Novel Stochastic Framework for the MHD Generator in Ocean.
[Publication](https://www.techscience.com/cmc/v73n2/48386)

This paper discussed the optimization of the nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) system in a
deep learning framework. Used Levenberg-Marquardt Backpropagation neural networks (LMBNNs)
stochastic process and proposed solution for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system.
